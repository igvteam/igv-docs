# IGV 2.9.2 - Feb 2021

Fixes a bug where IGV eventually freezes with multiple error messages if you visit enough locations in a *BigWig* track. This problem was introduced in IGV version 2.9.0.  ([Git issue #911](http://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/911))

# IGV 2.9.1 - Feb 2021

# IGV 2.9.0 - Feb 2021

**New batch execution features**:

* Major improvements to performance and stability of IGV batch execution.

* Respect ***maxPanelHeight*** when creating snapshots.

* New ***colorBy*** batch command to control coloring of alignments. Matches the menu in the alignment track.

* New batch commands to control the sequence track. ([Git issue #836](http://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/836); [PR #868](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/pull/868))
    * ***setSequenceStrand*** - valid values (case insensitive): +, positive, -, negative
    * ***setShowSequenceTranslation*** - valid values (case insensitive): true, false 

**Other new features:**

* New alignment track menu item to copy a clipped read sequence to the clipboard. ([Git issue #860](http://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/860))

* New option to group alignments by reference concordance. ([Git issue #852](http://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/852))

* Changing the track color for feature tracks now supports setting different colors for the positive and negative strands. 

**Bug fixes:**

* IGV would sometimes freeze when receiving commands from a port.

* *BigBED* tracks were not handling chromosome aliasing, causing the track not to load in some cases. For example, if chromosome 1 was specified as "1" in the file and as "chr1" in the reference genome.  ([Git issue #898](http://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/898))

* The name panel displayed extra characters for tracks loaded from URLs that had parameters with slashes ("/"). ([Git issue #897](http://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/897))

* Handle *BED* files with columns separated by multiple tabs. ([Git issue #890](http://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/890)).  *BED* files can be whitespace delimited, multiple consecutive tabs == a single "whitespace".

* Tracks loaded from *.narrowpeak* files would sometimes be colored incorrectly, while tracks from *.narrowPeak* (capital P) were correct. ([Git issue 881](http://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/881))

# IGV 2.18.4 - September 2024

**Bug fixes and other minor updates**

* CRAM files would not load properly with genbank references using alternative chromosome names.  [Github issue #1573](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1573)
* Genomes with "twobit" reference sequeneces triggered an error when reading near the end of the sequence.  [Github issue #1586](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1586)
* Bigbed reading errors.

# IGV 2.18.2 - August 2024

**Bug fixes and other minor updates**

* Panning alignment track triggered re-ordering of alignment rows
* New options for read alignments marked 'duplicate'
    * Filter duplicates
    * Highlight duplicates with crosshatch pattern

# IGV 2.18.1 - August 2024

**Bug fixes and other minor updates**

* The command-line **igvtools** were not running correctly. [GitHub issue #1540](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1540).
* Clicking on a feature track (e.g. the RefSeq track) in `Collapsed` mode would only display one feature. [GitHub issue #1541](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1541).
* The curves representing splice junctions would sometimes “overshoot” the junction boundaries. [GitHub issue #1535](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1535).
* Clarified the "zoom in" message for whole genome view. [GitHub issue #1539](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1539).

# IGV 2.18.0 - July 2024

**New features**

* If a file does not have a recognizable filename extenstion, IGV now tries to determine the file format from the file contents. This works for BAM, CRAM, BigWig, BigBed, VCF, GFF3, and TDF content. [GitHub issue #1526](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1526).
* New display mode for alignment tracks: `Full` displays a single alignment per row. [GitHub issue #1531](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1531).
* New right-click menu option to remove empty data panels. 

**Bug fixes**

* Wait cursor could hang in some situations. 
* Chromosome order was not maintained when using FASTA files to define the reference genome. [GitHub issue #1489](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1489).
* Now can automatically detect
* Restored missing BAM files to Encode 2012 menus.

**Other updates**

* Third Gen alignment preferences:
    * Quick consensus mode is now FALSE by default. [GitHub issue #1516](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1516).
    * Hiding small indels is now FALSE by default.

* Long-read RNA-seq alignments are now assigned an experiment type of `RNA` by default. The experiment type can be changed to `3rd Gen` via the track's right-click popup menu. [GitHub issue #1491](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1491).

* Ultima Genomics alignment data. [GitHub issue #1490](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/pull/1490).
    * Fixed several edge cases and inconsistencies in the coloring of data from Ultima Genomics.
    * Added a new option to the Alignment preferences: `INDEL coloring uses min quality (ultima)` colors indels by the minimal quality of the homopolymer run rather than by the quality of the specific change.
    * Thanks to Thomas Garrety (Hartwig Foundation) for insightful comments and feature suggestions.

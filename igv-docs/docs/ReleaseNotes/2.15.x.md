# IGV 2.15.4 - Dec 2022

**New Features:**

* In hyperlinks that load data into IGV (see documentation [here](../UserGuide/advanced/external_control.md#html-links)), the merge paramater now can be assigned the value ```ask```, which will pop up a dialog and ask the user whether or not to unload the current session before loading the new data tracks.  [Git Issue #1261](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1261) 

* Coordinates in *.mut* mutation files are now by default assumed to be *"0 based half-open"* (UCSC Genome Browser style). There is also a new parameter in ***View > Preferences > Mutations*** that allows you to change the default behavior to *"1 based, fully-closed"*, and a *.mut* file can include a new ```#coords``` directive to explictly set the value to either 0 or 1.

**Bug fixes:**

* In batch scripts, quoting the string for the genome path was not working. [Git Issue #1251](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1251) 

# IGV 2.15.2 - Nov 2022

**Bug fixes:** 

* IGV did not start up when using a proxy. [Git Issue #1251](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1251) 
* IGV asked for Google login even for for public Google datasets.
* Sashimi plots truncated graphs if multiple samples were loaded.

**Updates and bug fixes**

* Change "mut" file parsing to assume 1-based coordinates by default.  [Git Issue 1226](https://github.com/igvteam/igv/issues/1226)

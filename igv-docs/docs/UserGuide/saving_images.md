# Image formats

Images of the IGV view can be saved in the PNG raster format or the SVG vector format.

# Saving images from IGV menus

To save an image of the **whole IGV window** below the toolbar:

* Select *Save PNG Image...* or *Save SVG Image...* in the main *File* menu.

To save an image of only the tracks that are together in a **panel in the IGV window**:

* Right-click on one of the tracks and select *Save PNG Image...* or *Save SVG Image...* in the pop-up menu.


# Saving images from batch scripts

Batch scripts can be used to automatically run a series of IGV commands, including saving snapshot images of the IGV window. See the sections on [running batch scripts](tools/batch.md) and [external control of IGV](advanced/external_control.md) for more details.

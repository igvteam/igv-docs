<p class="page-title"> Sample attributes</p>

Attributes can be associated with tracks and used for filtering, sorting, and grouping data. By default all tracks have 
at least 3 attributes: Data File, Data Type, and Name. To display additional attributes, [load a sample attribute file](../FileFormats/SampleInfo.md). 
IGV displays attribute names and values in the attributes panel.

## Color-coded attribute values

IGV uses color-coded blocks to represent the attribute values.

* Hover over a colored block to display the attribute value.
* Click a colored block to select all tracks with that attribute value. IGV indicates a selected track by highlighting 
* the track name.  **Tip**: Keep in mind that clicking an attribute may select tracks that are not visible in the data 
* panel. Scroll down the data panel to view all the selected tracks.
* Click an attribute name at the top of the panel to sort tracks based on that attribute value.

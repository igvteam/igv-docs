<p class="page-title"> User preferences </p>

You can change many user interface and track settings with the IGV Preferences window, accessed from the `View` menu.
Most setting changes are applied immediately, but some will require an IGV restart.

**Resetting to Default**

Preferences are stored in the `prefs.properties` file in the `igv` directory,  normally located in the user home 
directory. To restore IGV's default preferences, first shutdown IGV, then delete or rename the prefs.properties file. 
When you relaunch IGV, a new prefs.properties file is created with default settings.

The prefs.properties file saves IGV user settings changed during use, typically from the various Preferences panels. For
example, IGV opens each new session with the last used reference genome and this information is saved in the
prefs.properties file.

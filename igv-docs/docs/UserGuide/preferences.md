<p class="page-title"> User preferences </p>

You can change many user interface and track settings in the *Preferences* window, accessed from the *View* menu.
Most setting changes are applied immediately, but some will require an IGV restart. 

The preferences are stored in the `prefs.properties` file in the `igv` directory,  normally located in the user home directory. 

**Resetting to default values**

To restore IGV's default preferences, first shut down IGV, then delete the prefs.properties file, or rename it if you wish to save the old settings. 
When you relaunch IGV, a new prefs.properties file is created with default settings.

Display Notes
-------------

* By default, IGV displays segmented data as a blue-to-red heatmap where the data range is -1.5 to 1.5. If loaded
  segmented data appears in tracks colored all red, check the data values
  and modify the data range as necessary.
* To change track display options, use the track pop-up menu. The commands that
  appear in the pop-up menu are those relevant to any data track.

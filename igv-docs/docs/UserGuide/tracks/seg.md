Display Notes
-------------

* By default, IGV displays segmented data as a blue-to-red heatmap where the data range is -1.5 to 1.5. If loaded
  segmented data appears in tracks colored all red, check the data values
  and [modify the data range](<?php echo base_path(); ?>ChangeDataDisplay#DataRange) as necessary.
* To change track display options, use the [track pop-up menu](<?php echo base_path(); ?>PopupMenus). The commands that
  appear in the pop-up menu are those relevant to any data track.

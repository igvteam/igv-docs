!!! Note "For Mac users:"
Mac apps are not provided for the IGV snapshot build. To **run the snapshot build on a Mac**: 

1. Click on the *command line* version above and unzip the downloaded distribution file to a directory of your choice. You will see that several launcher scripts are provided in the distribution. The Mac version is named *igv.sh*.

2. Open a *Terminal* window and enter `<Full path to the IGV snapshot directory>/igv.sh`. For example, if the IGV snapshot files are in */Users/jane/IGV_snapshot*, enter `/Users/jane/IGV_snapshot/igv.sh`. Alternatively, enter `cd /Users/jane/IGV_snapshot` to go to that directory, and then `./igv.sh`.

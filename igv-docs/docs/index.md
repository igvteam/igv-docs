# Overview

The **Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)** is a high-performance, easy-to-use, interactive tool for the visual
exploration of genomic data. It supports flexible integration of all the common types of genomic data and metadata,
investigator-generated or publicly available, loaded from local or cloud sources.

IGV is available in multiple forms, including:

* the original **IGV** - a Java desktop application,
* **IGV-Web** \- a web application,
* **igv.js** \- a JavaScript component that can be embedded in web pages _(for_ _developers)_

This site is focused on the IGV desktop application. See **[https://igv.org](https://igv.org )** for links to all forms
of IGV.
